[[ The Cat Collector Game ]]

As explained in the introductory message to the program, the purpose of this game is to collect as many cats as possible and level up through the different game mechanics.

[Cat Types]
There are 4 possible cats to adopt, which will appear at random depending on the location:
    - The Calico Cat: the easiest cat to adopt. The player will always be able to adopt them unless they are in the library.
    - The Orange Cat: can only be adopted if the player has "Treat" in inventory.
    - The Black Cat: all black cats have a randomized "magic level" going from 1 to 3. To adopt them the player needs to have at least the same number of "Dark Arts Book" in inventory as the cat's magic level.
    - The Feral Cat: the player will get 3 chances to attempt to adopt the cat, all with 30% possibilities to win.

[Locations]
There are 3 locations to visit:
    - The Library: a random book item (Dark Arts, Cat Care or Romance) will be added to the player inventory, and the Calico or Orange cat may appear.
    - The Store: a random item (Treat, Cat Toy or Bottled Water) will be added to the player inventory, and a Calico or Black cat may appear.
    - The Park: there are no items to add to inventory in this location, and all cats may appear. Unlike the other two, a cat is garanteed to always appear in this location.

[Successfully Adopting a Cat]
When the player manages to adopt a Cat, they will be prompted for a name, and the time and date will be saved as date of adoption.

[Cat Adoption Exceptions]
If the user is level 3 or higher, they will always be able to adopt a Black Cat or Orange Cat, even if they don't meet the Cat's requirements.

[Leveling up or down]
The player will level up when:
    - They adopt their first cat
    - They adopt a 5th cat
    - They adopt a 10th cat
    - The item "Cat Care Book" is added for the first time to the inventory
    - The item "Cat Toy" is added for the first time to the inventory
    - They adopt a Black Cat (only before they reach level 3)
The player will level down when:
    - They attempt to adopt a Feral Cat 3 times and fail.

[Player Stats]
Player stats can be viewed by selecting option 4 in the game menu. The player will be able to look at their game level, number of cats adopted and items in inventory. If they wish, they can also view the detailed information of the cats they adopted (name, description, date adopted and for Feral Cats, attempts until successfull adoption) and a list of the items in the inventory.

[Ending the game]
The game only ends when the user quits by selecting option 5 in the game menu. This is not a game that ends naturally or that the player can win; they can continue to collect cat for as long as they wish to!
